#  Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
#  Three line explanation of solution in plain english : This code detects if a cycle exists in a linked list using the two-pointer technique: slow moves one step, while fast moves two steps. If they meet, a cycle exists, and a second phase starts where head and slow both move one step at a time until they meet again â€” that node is the start of the cycle. If fast reaches None, the list has no cycle, and the function returns None.
